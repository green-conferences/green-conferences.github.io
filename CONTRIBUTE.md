Contributing is really easy. You just need to edit the data in `data.csv`. Here you can use a tool like Excel or similar. Please make sure to save to csv again. Then you can call the `generate.py` script which will generate all the html data. This will run in a github pipe fairly soon.

Please make sure to have pandas installed locally. This is only temporal
